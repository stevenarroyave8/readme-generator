# Readme-Generator
This weeks challenge required me to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquirer package.
## About
The purpose of this challenge was to use node.js to generate a README.md file. Using node to run the index.js will cause a series of questions to prompt up. These questions are created using the inquirer npm, once all the questions are answered it will generate the new file.
### Installations
Download or clone the reposisotry.
#### Usage
Initialize the application using Visual Studio Code.

Open the terminal on the main folder.

Initialize a project with package.json by typing 'npm init -y' in the terminal.

Install inquirer version 8.2.4 by typing ‘npm inquirer@8.2.4’ in the terminal.

Initialize the application with node.js by running the index.js file.

Questions will then prompt one by one after you enter your response.

Once all questions are answered a new readme will be generated in the file created.
